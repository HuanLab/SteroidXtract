# SteroidXtract

SteroidXtract is a deep-learning based bioinformatics tool for steroid MS2 extraction from untargeted metabolomics data.

SteroidXtract is written in Python and is publicly available for non-commercial use.

In "toolkits" folder, data augmentation methods and nested cross-validation are provided.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the user manual of SteroidXtract.
